Delving into the editing of specific weights in language models presents a challenge to previous work on causal tracing [d2]. The incorporation of phonology proves advantageous for isolated sign language recognition models [d3], while leveraging BERT pre-training enhances sign language recognition [d4]. Furthermore, the cutting-edge LQAE [d5] effectively aligns text-image data, LoCoNet [d6] accurately identifies speakers, and AVEC [d7] boosts noise robustness in speech recognition. Lastly, explore the generation of 3D talking faces with GeneFace [d8] and examine how Transformer models process complex input [d9]."
